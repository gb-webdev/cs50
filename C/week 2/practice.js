`Once upon a time there were some intrepid explorers who wandered into the Amazon. They found some amazing things! Piranhas are more adjective during the day, so make sure you cross the noun at night. Piranhas are attracted to fresh liquid and will most likely take a bite out of your body part if you verb. Whatever you do, if you have an open noun try and find another way to get back to place. Good luck!`
