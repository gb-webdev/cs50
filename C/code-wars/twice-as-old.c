// Your function takes two arguments:

// current father's age (years)
// current age of his son (years)
// Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son.
// Or in how many years he will be twice as old.
// The answer is always greater or equal to 0, no matter if it was in the past or it is in the future.
