C has different compilers that can be used.

For example when we have been using the "make" command in the terminal, we have been using the "clang" compiler.
There are usually additional steps in compiling code, however the CS50 library has an auto comiler with VS code to make it easier for now.

$clang -o name file-name.c -cs50
clang compiler | -o to chose a custom name for desired compiled code | desired name | file name | any 3rd party library that's added

This is what is happening under the hood, however, we will continue to use make, just for convenience.
This is just to know what is happening behind the scenes.
