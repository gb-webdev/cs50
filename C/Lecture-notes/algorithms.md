Algorithms cheat sheet for searching (slowest to fastest)

O(n2)          
O(n log n)
O(n)
O(log n)
O(1)

O = order of 

Upper bounds and lower bounds are terms used to described to describe how fast an algorithm is.

Upper bound = more steps
Lower bound = fewer steps

These are tems are often used to argue that your algorithm is better since it is lower bound than the alternative.
