Syntax errors will be caught when you try to compile the code, but logical errors will not. 

It can be helpful to use printf along sections of the code to see your output.
However it can get confusing if you have a large code base to remove the pprint f's.

You can run the $debug command ($debug ./filename), you can set brake points in the "gutter" of vs code (to the left of the numbers).
The command will open a GUI and let you cycle through the selected functions or code.
It'll will highlight the code you want to check, here you can check data and variable data etc.
Above there buttons and arrows to move through the code in steps or loops through each iteration etc. Then you can see how the data behaves from that, to lead to solving the bug.

Rubber ducking is a powerful debugging tool. Don't stare at your screen for hours and hours. Take a break and talk to a human or a rubber duck.
